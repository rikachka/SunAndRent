## Inspiration
A lot of people have items that they don't want to store at home either because of their big size or seasonal usage or uncertainty in usage in the near future. They are not ready to get rid of them and prefer to give the items to any external storage system and pay some money for warehousing.
However it is much more attractive to earn money through goods that you do not use instead of spending money on them. Sharing economy makes possible to deal with this problem. You no longer store the object at home and at the same time you receive money through the rent.

## What it does
Sun & Rent provides opportunity to:
- send stuff to external storage
- return items back to the owner
- share goods earning money
- track your own items
- rent other people's stuff
The main goal of the service is to unite customers who want to store things with those who want to rent items cheaply.

## How we built it
We built a Django web service using standard frontend stack and Sqlite3 for data storage. We thought about User Experience and Business Model to satisfy customers as well as the owners of the service.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was the usage of unfamiliar technology and the desire to create the best service from the prospective of future users.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We thought through the business model properly and created the working prototype that supports all the main use cases.

## What we learned
We learned how to create Django web service, use frontend stack and analyse the product both on the side of the users and owners.

## What's next for Sun & Rent
There are some future improvements that will make the service even more attractive.
- Rating to items and users to decrease the worries about low-quality goods and irresponsible people.
- History of stored items to show who and when took the goods, how much money was earned. The goal is the motivation to store and share more items.
